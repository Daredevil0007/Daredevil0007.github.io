## Iris Scanning
### Overview of Iris Scanning
In this technology growing era it is important to protect the data or the information wisely because the older way of securing the data using lockers could not be helpful as the world is focusing more on the digitalization. Organizations are keener to use new technologies to not allow access to the unauthorized people. Biometric techniques are popular than other technologies as it depends on the persons unique physical characters. Although there are many technologies such as Fingerprint scanning and retina scanning etc. This report suggests Iris Scanner more than any other. This scanning algorithm is depending on the high-resolution image of irises which is a part of human eye (unique from one person to another). The organ iris remains stable in the human body throughout the lifetime. Due the features such as uniqueness, speed, and accuracy this technology has evolved as most trustable for identification and authorization. 
   
Mostly iris scanners use a light source of 750nm wavelength to produce near infrared image. This method helps the scanner to ignore the light effect from cornea and it helps to focus on the unique part of iris. As this method is difficult to complete the identification task it is recommended for iris scanners to use visual wavelength images. There are 3 major steps to be focused on an iris scanning. 
	Clarity of the Captured Image – Iris Scanners could use manual or automated technique to capture the iris, but it should be focused on iris and it is must to capture the image with clarity. 
	Locating the Iris – After successfully completing on the focus and clarity of the image scanner then locates the boundaries of iris followed by pupil center and this is also the center of iris circle. Next it decides on the encoded structure that is suitable for analysis. 
	Template Storage and Matching – During this step, the captured image will be stored in a database and then it is checks with the already stored image in the database for to complete the authentication process. 
  
### Goals for using Iris Scanner
	The main aim of using any of the technology to provide secured physical access to a machine or place. In this case iris scanners are dependable as it contains many characteristics which are mentioned below,
	It is unique for every individual even it differs for identical twins.
	Iris includes more than 260 structure variables to analyze which makes the results accurate. 
	In an automated iris scanner, an individual does not need to remove the spectacle or contact lenses to provide reading. 
	Comparatively to other biometrical features iris has less chance to damage itself as it has eyelid, cornea, and aqueous humor as protection layers. 
	Iris does not degenerate even if the person is getting older. 
	Usage of 512 biometric encryption template ensure it is hard to forge or steal as it is difficult to decrypt, and it is safe from phishing attacks.  

	Using Iris scanner helps to maintain the accuracy and speed of providing the access to the authorized person.

	The iris scanners are capable of handling large databases and this helps the organization to store many irises which ensures the scanner could be used from the entrance to private space of an organization such as server room. 

 
 

## Potential Adversaries and Threat
### Fingerprint Scanner
Fingerprint scanner is one of the popular or commonly used technology in many organizations to physically verify a person. This is a unique identity every person has which differs for every individual. The features or characters which shows the difference of individuals’ fingerprint could be used according to the technology to verify the person. As this technology exists for a long time comparing to other biometric scanners it has evolved a lot. Fingerprint scanners used many algorithms from the past to present to provide accurate and quick results. There are two main techniques to scan fingerprint which are known as optical scan and capacitive scan. The optimal scanner will request the person to place the finger in the machine by producing the light on that spot. Once the digital image of the victim captured using light-sensitive microchip or similar sensor it will be checked with the already existing fingerprints in the database for matches. The capacitive scanner reads fingerprint electrically. This depends on the hollows and ridges of a fingerprint. If a finger touches the surface ridges and hollows have a slight difference from the surface. Using this distance, the system will create an image of fingerprint. Then the image will search for similar image in the database. 
Threats 
	Fingerprints can Change – If a person gets a wound or cut in the finger the pattern of the fingerprint of that specific person will be changed from the older one. As fingerprint scanners are not capable of identifying the change the authorized person could completely lose the access to the system. 

	Forged – Although fingerprints differ from one to another there are several techniques available to steal someone’s fingerprint. Even a person who has less knowledge about the system or technology is capable of stealing someone’s fingerprint as they are embed very easily on a surface. If an attacker steals the fingerprint there after it is not that difficult to trick the machine like an authorized person as the scanners does not find difference between image and actual finger. 

	Wrong Decision Making – The fingerprint scanners will only allow the already registered fingerprint which should be there in its database. Even though it is the same person the fingerprint of every single finger differs. So, the system will only recognize the registered finger which is placed properly in the surface even if it is the authorized person. In this case an authorized persons’ permission could be denied during an authorization phase by placing the wrong finger. If the scanner started malfunctioning due to an attack or any other reasons, there are chances for giving permission to non-authorized people.    

### Facial Recognition
This is also a technology which is based on the biometrics to allow access or authentication in a workplace. There are two main methods in facial recognition to identify a person such as digital video or digital image. The process of completing the verification is so simple the camera from the scanner will capture a live image of the person who is requesting to authenticate. Then the captured image will be checked with the database which already contains the images of registered face. If the live image of face has a similar image in the database, it will allow access to the individual otherwise the access will be denied.
Threats 
	Capturing Images should be in High Resolution – The image which is captured live and the image which is stored in the database should be at almost same resolution. If either one of the both images is having low-resolution image the scanner is not compatible to find similarities. This problem could occur in area which has less light and the timeline of the images taken could play a major role if both images are from different timeline (Day/Night).         

	Neutral Expression – The user must be aware on giving a neutral expression while registering the face and while authenticating. Failing to pose in neutral expression could deny the permission of access for the person as it is difficult for the individual to repeat the same expression. Reducing the strength of perfection to avoid issues regarding facial expression could reduce the strength of security level.     

### Potential Weakness of Iris Scanner
	Distance – A human iris is small, and the scanner will fail to read the iris to give permission if it is located from a distance from the scanner. It is must for a person to stay as close as possible to complete the phase of authorization. 

	Movement – If a person is not stable in projecting the iris to the scanner such as moving the eyeball and closing the eyes the device will fail to read the iris of the individual which leads to denying the authentication access. Mostly, as per the human nature it is difficult to stable and position the iris in the first attempt itself. 

	Expensive – Iris scanners are high in price comparing to other biometric based authentication scanners. As this is one of the newly grown technology and in demand it is only recommended for the big corporates or organizations and government sectors due to unaffordability for other small enterprises. 
                            
### Potential Defenses
	The scanner must be placed in an average human height as it mostly helps the individuals to scan themselves without difficulties in placing the object in correct angle even though some could find it difficult. 

	As this scanner is highly recommended for militaries it is must to train the people who use this scanner mostly on registering and accessing. 

	The scanner should be used only in confidential area of an organization as the amount of iris scanners could increase the expenses on hardware.
